# HackBox

HackBox is a multiplayer party game platform inspired by JackBox to host games such as Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity. You can either create a new game from a list of premade games or join an existing game.

To begin a game, simply go to the **[live site](http://)** and select "New Game". You will be provided with a game code such as "HKGY", which will allow users to join your game. You join the game by going to the **[live site](http://)**, entering the room code and a username of your choice.
