### Backend Skeleton Setup

Set up Apollo server on top of express/node server


Set up GraphQL typeDefs (configure querys and models)


Set up graphQL resolvers (configure what graphql query returns)

Configure websockets or graphql subscriptions 


NPM packages:

`npm init`

`npm install â€”save babel-cli babel-preset-env babel-watch express  graphql graphql-tools apollo-server-express`


files: 

`server.js - apollo/express/node`
`schema.js - typeDefs`
`resolver.js - configure what gets returned`


.babelrc = 
      `{
        "presets": ["env"]
      }`

package.json add
 `"scripts": {
    "dev": "babel-watch server.js"
  }`

server.js = 

    import express from 'express';
    import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
    import { graphqlExpress, graphiqlExpress } from 'apollo-server-express';
    import schema from './schema';
    
    const app = express();
    
    app.use('/graphiql', graphiqlExpress({
        endpointURL: '/graphql'
    }));
    
    app.use('/graphql', bodyParser.json(), graphqlExpress({schema}));

    app.listen(4000, () => console.log('Express server running on port 4000'));
